        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>while the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to bite. Drain and set aside. While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven over 375 degrees F(190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble lasagna: spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of the baking dish just to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover.</li>
        <li>Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 39 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
